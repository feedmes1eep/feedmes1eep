## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**My name is <private>. I am 24 years old (as of 2024).**
**I'm currently working as an Network Engineer ~~cough even though my JT is something else cough~~**
**Coding has become more or less of a hobby for me now, and might pick it up more later on as a DevOp Engineer.**

**Am always looking to improve my programming skills. If you notice any issues with my scripts/programs, please let me know.**
